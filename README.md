## PRONOUNCIATION GUIDE

The wolof pronunciation system is relatively simple. Every symbol stands for only one sound, that is every symbol is pronounced the same way in every word.
The distinction between short and long vowels is very important, because it is sometimes the only way to distinguish pairs of words which have different meanings. Long vowels are always doubled, while short vowels are not.
There is a lot of prenalization in wolof. There usually occur with nasals such as m, n, etc...

## VOWELS

As indicated, wolof vowels are either long or short. A long vowel is indicated a doubling of the symbol, and it must be pronounced a little longer than a short vowel (which is not doubled). Long and short vowels can occur anywhere in the word.
